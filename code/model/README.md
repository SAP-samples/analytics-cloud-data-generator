# Sample dimensions for models

- Refer to the folders here for CSV containing a mapping of Member ID to Descriptions. These can be used as the foundation for creating a model in SAP Analytics Cloud. Once the model is constructed and the dimensions created, the fact data generated in the previous steps can be directly imported to the model.

- Best practice is to generate fact data based on Member ID, as lengthy descriptions exponentially increase the size of the generated file.
